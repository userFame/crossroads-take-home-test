# Crossroads Take Home Test

This was created with the create react app. To get this running, first use yarn to install using `yarn install` to download the create react app dependencies, bootstrap, and oktokit. To run in development mode, type `yarn start` from within the terminal. It should open a window directed to http://localhost:3000.

Before running, it may be wise to create a `.env.local` in the main directory and add `REACT_APP_PAT_GITHUB=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` in it so that Octokit works properly. This is a Personal Access Token generated for Oktokit to get the data necessary for commits.

That should be it to get the app working! you should see the commits in card form. Thanks for your time!
